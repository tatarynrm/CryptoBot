It makes use of the novel Dual Node technology developed by KardiaChain itself. \r\n\r\nThis technology allows simultaneous access to the ledgers of KardiaChain and other blockchain networks. It lets traders retain full control of their assets while being able to transact with fiat currencies and switch between blockchain networks. The main objective of KAIDEX is to facilitate high-speed transactions, high liquidity, and a simple user experience for traders across the globe. In other words, it aims to provide a centralized user experience on a decentralized platform. \r\n\r\nKAIDEX is also working towards facilitating low transaction fees, faster transactions, low slippage, and limit stop loss, and market orders. New technology like this could finally solve the dilemma traders faced for years and increase the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. \"",
